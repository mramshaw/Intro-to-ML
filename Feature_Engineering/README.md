# Feature Engineering - Machine Learning Recipes #9

This is a more general video, and less of an actual hands-on.

The __Facets Dive__ tool & data may be visualized at the following [link](https://pair-code.github.io/facets/).

In order to have the same display as in the video, set __Color__ to __Color By target__ as shown:

![Color_by_Target](images/Color_by_Target.png)

There is also a very nice
[Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/random-forests/tensorflow-workshop/blob/master/examples/07_structured_data.ipynb)
which seems to be the last part of what looks like an interesting
[TensorFlow workshop](https://github.com/random-forests/tensorflow-workshop).
