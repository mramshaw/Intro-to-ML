# Fun with Word Vectors

[![Known Vulnerabilities](http://snyk.io/test/github/mramshaw/Intro-to-ML/badge.svg?style=plastic&targetFile=Simple_SVD%2Frequirements.txt)](http://snyk.io/test/github/mramshaw/Intro-to-ML?style=plastic&targetFile=Simple_SVD%2Frequirements.txt)

This is from 'Lecture 3: More Word Vectors' of Stanford's [Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/).

Interestingly, the full-stop or period ('.') is treated as a word in its own right.
