Here is how the folks at [nVidia](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2016/07/29/whats-difference-artificial-intelligence-machine-learning-deep-learning-ai/) see the relationship between Artifical Intelligence, Machine Learning and Deep Learning:

Towards the beginning of my career, I was interested in AI and joined a society founded by [Donald Michie](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2007/jul/10/uk.obituaries1) - who was then at the University of Edinburgh. I wonder how much things have progressed since then?

Machine Learning is hot right now, and of course the cloud providers have noticed.

Here is Google's Cloud offering:
